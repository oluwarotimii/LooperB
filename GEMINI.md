## Current Limitation:

- **Issue:** Still unable to reliably send HTTP requests that require request bodies or complex headers using `curl` (due to persistent shell escaping issues on the user's system) or `web_fetch` (due to an internal tool execution error or design limitation for `localhost`).
- **Impact:** Cannot proceed with comprehensive testing of endpoints that require specific input (e.g., `POST /api/auth/register`, `POST /api/businesses`).
