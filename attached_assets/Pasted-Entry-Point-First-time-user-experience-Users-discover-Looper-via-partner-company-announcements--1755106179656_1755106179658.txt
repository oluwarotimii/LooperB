User journey
In the heart of Lagos, Ada, a mid-level banker, faces the usual lunchtime conundrum—long queues, high prices, and a craving for something new. By chance, her bank introduces her to Looper: a fresh solution promising “save food, save money.”
Ada quickly signs up on her phone, attracted by today’s “Hotel Chef’s Special”—a gourmet sauce with a steep discount that lets her enjoy flavors usually reserved for five-star guests. Within minutes, her order is placed, payment confirmed via Paystack, and her pick-up time sealed.

Arriving at the hotel outlet, Ada finds a ready package, her name and QR code greeted with a warm smile. She shares feedback on the dish in-app, effusive over the surprise and quality. Not only does her bank get recognized for corporate sustainability, but Ada feels good for her pocket—and for the knowledge she’s helping turn “waste” into a delicious lunch. That afternoon, she forwards a code to her colleagues —an office-wide rescue of breakfast pastries from a top island hotel is soon in motion.

Meanwhile, the hotel is not only reducing its food waste and demonstrating environmental stewardship, but also earning new revenue and a boost to its brand image—a true win-win, powered by Looper.
